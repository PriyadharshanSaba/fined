                <h2>Chapter 1: The Story of Money — From Barter to Bytes</h2>
                <p>Long before coins and cards, people traded what they had for what they needed — a fisherman swapped
                    his catch for a farmer’s grain. But barter had a flaw: what if the farmer didn’t want fish that day?
                </p>
                <p>That’s where money was born — a simple tool to make exchange easier. From cowrie shells and metal
                    coins to paper notes and now digital wallets and crypto, money has constantly evolved to match how
                    societies grow and trade.</p>
                <p>At its heart, money isn’t just cash or coins — it’s trust. A shared belief that a piece of paper or a
                    number on a screen holds value because others agree it does.</p>
                <p>Money fuels everything — from your morning coffee to global economies. But while money has evolved,
                    our understanding hasn’t. Financial literacy bridges that gap — because when you understand money,
                    you don’t just use it — you control it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h2>Chapter 2: The Next Chapter — The Art of Budgeting</h2>
                <p>If money is the language of life, budgeting is how you learn to speak it fluently. Every rupee tells
                    a story — what you earn, spend, and value. Most of us never track that story — we let money come and
                    go without direction.</p>
                <p>Budgeting isn’t about restriction; it’s about intention. It helps you guide your money toward what
                    truly matters. It’s the foundation of financial freedom and the first step toward building wealth.
                </p>
                <p>Before you grow wealth, you must manage what you already have. Budgeting teaches that discipline —
                    turning income into impact.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h2>Chapter 3: From Saving to Growing — The Power of Investing</h2>
                <p>Once you’ve mastered budgeting, the next step is making your money grow. Saving keeps you safe, but
                    investing helps you expand your possibilities.</p>
                <p>Investing means putting your money to work — in businesses, ideas, and assets that generate value.
                    It’s not gambling — it’s ownership, patience, and discipline.</p>
                <p>Saving is like storing water in a tank; investing is channeling it into a field. One protects, the
                    other produces. Both matter, but investing creates growth through compounding — where your earnings
                    themselves start to earn more.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h2>Chapter 4: How to Think Like an Investor</h2>
                <p>Investing begins with mindset. An investor doesn’t see money as something to spend but as a tool to
                    build and create value.</p>
                <p>Thinking like an investor means focusing on the long term, staying consistent, and letting time — not
                    emotion — drive results. Markets rise and fall, but real wealth is built quietly through discipline
                    and perspective.</p>
                <p>To think like an investor is to see value where others see price — to focus on growth over instant
                    gratification, and purpose over impulse.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h2>Chapter 5: Understanding Investment Options</h2>
                <p>There’s no single “best” investment — only the one that fits your goals, risk comfort, and time
                    horizon. Here are the main types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Stocks (Equity):</strong> Ownership in companies; high growth potential but short-term
                        volatility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mutual Funds & SIPs:</strong> Professionally managed, diversified, and ideal for
                        consistent long-term investing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bonds & Fixed Income:</strong> Safer, steady returns — great for stability in your
                        portfolio.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gold & Real Estate:</strong> Traditional stores of value; protect against inflation but
                        require larger capital.</li>
                    <li><strong>Digital Assets:</strong> Emerging and volatile — invest only if you fully understand the
                        risks.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Diversify! A balanced mix of different assets protects you when markets
                    fluctuate.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h2>Chapter 6: The Role of Risk and Emotion in Investing</h2>
                <p>Investing isn’t just math — it’s mindset. Risk and emotion play huge roles in every decision.</p>
                <h3>Understanding Risk</h3>
                <p>All investments carry risk. It’s not about avoiding it but managing it — spreading investments,
                    staying patient, and aligning them with your comfort level.</p>
                <h3>The Emotional Side</h3>
                <p>Money stirs emotion — excitement, fear, greed. Successful investors recognize those feelings but
                    don’t let them control their actions. They stay grounded through market ups and downs.</p>
                <h3>Balancing Head and Heart</h3>
                <p>Good investing balances logic and emotion. Build a strategy you trust and stick to it — let your
                    plan, not your panic, decide your actions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h2>Chapter 7: How to Start Investing</h2>
                <p>Every investor begins the same way — by starting. You don’t need to know everything, just enough to
                    begin wisely.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Define Your Goals:</strong> Know why you’re investing — short-term wants or long-term
                        independence.</li>
                    <li><strong>Understand Risk Appetite:</strong> Be honest about your comfort with volatility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Start Small, Stay Consistent:</strong> Even ₹500/month in an SIP can grow meaningfully.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Choose the Right Platform:</strong> Use trusted, transparent, SEBI-regulated brokers.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Diversify:</strong> Spread money across asset classes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Review, Don’t React:</strong> Monitor progress but avoid emotional decisions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keep Learning:</strong> Financial growth begins with curiosity — not luck.</li>
                </ul>
