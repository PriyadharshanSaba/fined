                <h2>Chapter 1: What Is the Stock Market?</h2>
                <p>Imagine your favourite coffee brand — say, Tata Coffee — wants to open 500 new outlets across India.
                    That kind of expansion needs money — to buy land, build stores, hire staff, and market the brand.
                    Instead of borrowing a huge amount from banks, the company can raise money by offering ownership
                    stakes — called shares — to people like you and me.</p>
                <p>When you buy a share, you’re not just investing your money — you’re becoming a co-owner of that
                    company. If the business does well, your share becomes more valuable too. You might even receive a
                    dividend — a portion of the company’s profits.</p>
                <p>This is the essence of the stock market — an organized marketplace where companies raise funds and
                    investors share in their success.</p>

                <h3>Where All Listed Companies Live</h3>
                <p>Listed companies are those whose shares are available for public trading. They must follow SEBI’s
                    regulations and disclose their performance regularly. Listing gives them credibility, transparency,
                    and access to investors.</p>
                <p>From giants like Reliance and Infosys to new-age startups like Nykaa and Zomato — thousands of
                    companies are listed on India’s stock exchanges.</p>

                <h3>A Marketplace Built on Belief</h3>
                <p>The stock market isn’t just about numbers — it’s about belief in the future of businesses. Prices
                    move constantly due to demand, supply, and global or company events. It’s a living reflection of the
                    economy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h2>Chapter 2: Why Does the Stock Market Exist?</h2>
                <p>The stock market exists because ambition needs capital. Before markets, only kings and banks could
                    fund growth. When the Dutch East India Company issued the first shares in the 1600s, it gave
                    ordinary people the power to invest — birthing the modern economy.</p>
                <p>In India, companies like Infosys, TCS, and Reliance have used stock markets to raise funds, expand,
                    and innovate — creating jobs and wealth. Every trade represents investment that fuels national
                    growth.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h2>Chapter 3: The Key Players — Who Makes It All Work</h2>
                <p>When you tap ‘Buy’ on your trading app, an intricate system springs into action — powered by
                    investors, brokers, exchanges, clearing corporations, depositories, and SEBI.</p>

                <h3>1. Investors — The Heartbeat of the Market</h3>
                <p>Investors can be retail (everyday individuals), institutional (mutual funds, insurance firms), or
                    foreign (FIIs). Their collective decisions determine which businesses thrive.</p>

                <h3>2. Brokers — The Bridge Between You and the Market</h3>
                <p>Brokers like Zerodha, Upstox, and Groww connect you to the exchange. They handle order routing,
                    compliance, and reports — acting as your gateway to trading.</p>

                <h3>3. Stock Exchanges — The Marketplace</h3>
                <p>The NSE and BSE match buyers and sellers, ensuring fast and fair trades. They’re the market’s
                    matchmakers, executing millions of transactions in seconds.</p>

                <h3>4. Clearing Corporations — The Market’s Guarantee</h3>
                <p>Institutions like NCL and ICCL verify both sides of a trade, ensuring money and shares are exchanged
                    correctly. They guarantee smooth settlement and eliminate counterparty risk.</p>

                <h3>5. Depositories — The Digital Vaults</h3>
                <p>Your shares are stored digitally with NSDL or CDSL — accessed through your broker-linked Demat
                    account. This replaces old paper certificates with secure digital ownership.</p>

                <h3>6. SEBI — The Watchdog of the Market</h3>
                <p>SEBI ensures transparency and fairness. It regulates brokers, monitors insider trading, approves
                    IPOs, and ensures companies disclose results on time.</p>

                <h3>Putting It All Together — The Journey of a Trade</h3>
                <p>When you buy shares, your order passes through your broker, gets matched on the exchange, verified by
                    the clearing corporation, and credited to your Demat — all under SEBI’s oversight. In seconds, your
                    investment journey begins.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h2>Chapter 4: IPOs & FPOs — How Companies Raise Money</h2>
                <p>An IPO (Initial Public Offering) is when a private company goes public, allowing the public to
                    invest. It helps the company expand, repay debt, or fund innovation. An FPO (Follow-on Public
                    Offering) happens when an already-listed company issues more shares to raise additional capital.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h2>Chapter 5: Indices — The Market’s Pulse</h2>
                <p>Indices measure how groups of companies perform — much like a scoreboard in a cricket match. When
                    indices like the Nifty 50 or Sensex rise, it reflects optimism and growth. When they fall, it
                    signals caution.</p>

                <h3>Understanding What an Index Is</h3>
                <p>An index is a basket of selected companies representing the broader market or a sector. Sensex tracks
                    30 major companies; Nifty 50 tracks 50 top NSE-listed firms.</p>

                <h3>Sectoral and Thematic Indices</h3>
                <p>Indices like Nifty Bank, Nifty IT, or Nifty FMCG let investors focus on industries they believe in —
                    banking, tech, or consumer goods.</p>

                <h3>Why Indices Matter</h3>
                <p>Indices serve as benchmarks for fund performance, help investors gauge market sentiment, and even
                    form the basis for index funds and ETFs.</p>
