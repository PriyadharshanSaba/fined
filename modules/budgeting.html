        <h2>Chapter 1: Why Budgeting Matters</h2>
        <p>Most of us think we know where our money goes — until we start tracking it. A coffee here, a delivery there,
          a weekend out… and suddenly, the money’s gone before the month is.</p>
        <p>Budgeting gives your money clarity — it turns your spending from random into intentional. It’s the map that
          connects your goals with your daily choices.</p>
        <p>When you budget, you’re not limiting yourself — you’re choosing what’s worth your energy and effort.</p>
        <blockquote>“You can’t grow what you don’t track.”</blockquote>
        <p>Budgeting builds awareness, and awareness builds control — the foundation of wealth.</p>

      <div class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 2: Track Before You Tweak</h2>
        <p>Before you can improve your finances, you need to understand them. Start by tracking your spending for at
          least one full month.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>List every source of income — salary, side hustle, or freelance gigs.</li>
          <li>Note down expenses — group them as needs, wants, savings, and debt repayments.</li>
          <li>Review — where does most of your money go? What can you optimize?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tracking isn’t about judgment — it’s observation. You can’t fix leaks until you know where they are.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 3: The 50-30-20 Rule (and Beyond)</h2>
        <p>This timeless budgeting rule is simple and effective:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>50%</strong> — Needs (rent, groceries, utilities, transport)</li>
          <li><strong>30%</strong> — Wants (dining out, shopping, hobbies, travel)</li>
          <li><strong>20%</strong> — Savings & Investments (emergency fund, SIPs, long-term goals)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Start here, then adapt it — maybe 40-30-30 for big goals, or 60-25-15 for flexibility. There’s no perfect
          ratio, only consistency.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 4: Smart Saving & Spending Hacks</h2>
        <p>Money management isn’t just about cutting down — it’s about spending smarter:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Automate savings — transfer automatically on salary day.</li>
          <li>Sleep on impulse buys — wait 24 hours before spending.</li>
          <li>Track subscriptions — cancel unused ones.</li>
          <li>Use digital “envelopes” to separate fun and essentials.</li>
          <li>Keep a guilt-free fund — it keeps you consistent and sane.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Spend on what you love. Save on what doesn’t matter. Every expense becomes an investment in your priorities.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 5: Build Your Emergency Fund — Your First Line of Defense</h2>
        <p>Investing without an emergency fund is like driving fast without brakes.</p>
        <p>Life’s surprises — job loss, medical expenses, or repairs — come unannounced. Your emergency fund gives you
          the calm to handle them without debt.</p>

        <h3>How Much Should You Save?</h3>
        <p>Set aside 3–6 months of expenses (6–9 months if self-employed or supporting others). It’s your safety net —
          peace of mind over profit.</p>

        <h3>Where to Park It</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Debt funds (liquid / ultra-short-term) — ~6–7 % returns, quick access.</li>
          <li>High-interest savings accounts — for 1–2 months of liquidity.</li>
          <li>Short-term FDs — safe but less flexible.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Avoid risky assets — the goal here is stability and access.</p>

        <h3>How to Build It</h3>
        <p>Start small, stay consistent. Automate transfers, redirect bonuses, and keep this fund separate from regular
          savings.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 6: Automate & Simplify</h2>
        <p>The best budget is the one that runs on autopilot.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Auto-transfer a fixed % into savings or investments monthly.</li>
          <li>Set reminders for bills and reviews.</li>
          <li>Use apps or spreadsheets to track progress.</li>
          <li>Review money once a month — not daily.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Automation keeps you consistent — you don’t need to control every rupee, just direct it.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="chapter">
        <h2>Chapter 7: Your Finances, Your Control</h2>
        <p>Budgeting isn’t restriction — it’s freedom. Freedom to spend on what matters, save for what’s important, and
          live life on your terms.</p>
        <p>Every decision reflects your priorities — a promise to your future self. Awareness brings control; control
          brings peace and growth.</p>
        <p>Now that you understand how money moves, it’s time to grow it. Budget wisely today so you can invest boldly
          tomorrow.</p>
